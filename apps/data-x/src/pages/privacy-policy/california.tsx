              <p>A Consumer’s Other CCPA Rights and Choices</p>

              <p>
                The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific
                rights regarding their personal information. This section
                describes a consumer’s CCPA rights and explains how to exercise
                those rights.
              </p>

              <p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</p>

              <p>
                A consumer has the right to request that we disclose certain
                information to that consumer about Data-X&lsquo;s collection and
                use of that consumer’s personal information over the past 12
                months. Once we receive and confirm a consumer’s verifiable

                  The categories of personal information we collected about that

                <li>
                  The specific pieces of personal information we collected about
                  that consumer (also called a data portability request).

              <p>Deletion Request Rights</p>

              <p>
                A consumer has the right to request that Data-X delete any of
                its personal information that we have collected and retained,
                subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm a
                consumer’s verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and
                direct our service providers and/or customers to delete) that
                consumer’s personal information from our records, unless an
                exception applies.
              </p>

              <p>
                We may deny a consumer’s deletion request if retaining the
                information is necessary for us or our service providers or
                customers to:
              </p>

                  Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal
                  information, provide a good or service that a consumer
                  requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the
                  context of our ongoing business relationship with that
                  consumer, or otherwise perform our contract with that
                  consumer.

                  Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or
                  statistical research in the public interest that adheres to

                  information’s deletion may likely render impossible or
                  seriously impair the research’s achievement, if a consumer
                  previously provided informed consent.

                  it.

              <p>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</p>

              <p>
                To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
                described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to
                us by either:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>contact us</li>
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Only a consumer or a person registered with the California
                Secretary of State that a consumer authorizes to act on a
                consumer’s behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                related to a consumer’s personal information. A consumer may
                also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of that
                consumer’s minor child.
              </p>

              <p>
                A consumer may only make a verifiable consumer request for
                access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
                verifiable consumer request must:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide sufficient information that allows Data-X to
                  reasonably verify a consumer is the person about whom we
                  collected personal information or an authorized
                  representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe a consumer’s request with sufficient detail that
                  allows Data-X to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to
                  it.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We cannot respond to a consumer’s request or provide a consumer
                with personal information if we cannot verify the consumer’s
                identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
                personal information relates to that consumer. Making a
                verifiable consumer request does not require a consumer to
                create an account with us. We will only use personal information
                provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
                requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
              </p>

              <p>Response Timing and Format</p>

              <p>
                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
                45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days),
                we will inform the consumer of the reason and extension period
                in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or
                electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
                12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s
                receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons
                we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data
                portability requests, we will select a format to provide a
                consumer’s personal information that is readily useable and
                should allow a consumer to transmit the information from one
                entity to another entity without hindrance.
              </p>

              <p>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a consumer’s
                verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive,
                or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request
                warrants a fee, we will tell the consumer why we made that
                decision and provide the consumer with a cost estimate before
                completing that consumer’s request.
              </p>

              <p>Non-Discrimination</p>

              <p>
                We will not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any
                CCPA rights.
              </p>

              <p>Changes to Our Privacy Statement</p>

              <p>
                We reserve the right to amend this privacy statement at our
                discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy
                statement, we will provide notification by email or through a
                notice on our website homepage.

                *The Effective Date of the CCPA is January 1, 2020 and,

              <p>
                We anticipate our median number of days within which the
                business substantively responded to requests to know, requests
                to delete, and requests to opt-out will be three (3) business
                days based on similar operations, however, given the effective
                date of the CCPA, we do not have these metrics at this time.
