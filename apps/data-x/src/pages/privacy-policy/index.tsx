              </p>

              <p>
                First, if you visit our website (or open an email that we send
                you), we and third parties may use automated means to collect
                information about you your computer or other device, and your
                use of the Service. These automated means include technologies
                such as cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons and JavaScript, as
                well as functionality that can collect data from a mobile
                device.
              </p>

              <p>
                Cookies are files that websites and online services create and
                access on your computer or other Internet-connected device to
                uniquely identify your browser or to store information or
                settings on your device. Our Service may use HTTP cookies, HTML5
                cookies, Flash cookies and other types of local storage (such as
                browser-based or plugin-based local storage). If you use the
                Service, your browser may tell you how to be notified when you
                receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable
                certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies or
                local storage you may not be able to use all of the features of
                our website or other websites.
              </p>

              <p>
                In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies
                and other automated means, Web servers may log information such
                as your device type, operating system type, browser type,
                domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your
                system uses and the country and time zone where your device is
                located. The Web server logs also may record information such as
                the address of the Web page that referred you to our Service and
                the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
                They also may log information about your interaction with our
                Service, such as which pages you visit. To control which Web
                servers collect information by automated means, we may place
                tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are files that
                link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies. We
                also may include Web beacons in e-mail messages. We or third
                parties also may send instructions to your device using
                JavaScript or other computer languages to store or gather the
                sorts of information described above and other details about
                your interactions with the Service.
              </p>

              <p>
                If we provide a mobile app, we or third parties may collect
                information similar to the data mentioned above. In that case,
                we also may collect unique device identifiers (such as
                advertising IDs) and other mobile-specific types of information.
                For example, depending on your device and/or browser settings,
                we may collect your device’s geolocation.

                individual characteristics, activities, interests and other
                factors. For instance, we may “retarget” you with ads for our
                Service when you visit our website.

                These ad services may track your online activities over time by

                and they may use this information, and other information they

                third-party cookies together, and other automated technologies,
                and in some cases additional information, (i) to inform,

                You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer
                Opt-Out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer
                Opt-Out page to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from
                many companies involved in that type of advertising – for
                instance, ads based on your Internet browsing activities. The
                opt-outs apply only to the browser in which you set them. For
                example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then
                use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out
                in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.

                interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out,
                data may still be collected about your web browsing activities
                and you will still see advertising. Ads may be delivered based
                on other factors, such as the content of the web page in which
                they are shown, or demographic information obtained through
                other means.
