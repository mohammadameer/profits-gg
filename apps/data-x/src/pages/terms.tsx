              <p>
                Profits GG, Inc., along with its corporate affiliates (“Data-X”
                “we,” “our”) operates the “Service,” which is defined as any
                website or web page (or mobile application) on which this set of
                Terms appears (“Website”), and any data, services, activity or
                transactions that are offered, made available or facilitated
                through any of the above.
              </p>

              <p>
                These Terms of Service (“Terms of Service” or “Terms”) are a
                legally binding agreement that applies to the Service and
                governs your use of the Service and your (“you” or “your”)
                relationship with us. You accept and agree to these Terms of
                Service by either:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Accessing or using the Service;</li>
                <li>Clicking to accept these Terms of Service, or</li>
                <li>Accepting these Terms of Service in any other way.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you violate these Terms of Service, or if you do not agree to
                these Terms of Service, you shouldn’t access (and you don’t have
                our permission to access) the Service.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, if you intend to provide to us, or receive from us,
                data regarding European residents, please see Section 13, which
                you must agree to.
              </p>

                2. Changes to the terms of service
              </h4>

              <p>
                We may modify these Terms of Service in our sole discretion by
                posting updated versions of these Terms of Service on the
                Website or otherwise providing notice to you. All such changes
                shall become effective upon the posting of the revised Terms of
                Service on the Website or upon notice, as applicable.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-3xl font-bold">
                3. Changes to the service
              </h4>

              <p>
                We may change the features and functionality of the Service at
                any time. This may include adding, modifying or removing any
                features or functionality of the Service. The Terms of Service
                will apply to any changed version of the Service. We also may
                suspend or stop the Service altogether. In addition, we may
                impose or alter fees for new or existing aspects of the Service.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-3xl font-bold">
                4. Eligibility restrictions
              </h4>

              <p>
                To use the Service, you must have reached the age of majority in
                the jurisdiction where you live (in most U.S. states, that’s 18
                years old). If you are under this age, you shouldn’t use the
                Service or provide Submitted Data (defined below) to us.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-3xl font-bold">5. Your account</h4>

              <p>
                You will need to set up an account in order to access most
                aspects of the Service, including in most cases to submit data
                (“Submitted Data”) or to receive data (“Output Data”). You
                should read the important information about the rules governing
                the Submitted Data and Output Data, in the sections below.
                Important rules also govern your account itself. First, you must
                only provide account information (such as your name and email
                address) that is your own, and that is accurate. You should keep
                your contact information accurate as well, so that we can
                contact you if we need to, such as to deliver any important
                notices. We also strongly recommend changing your password
                periodically, and that you not share your password or account
                credentials with anyone else.
              </p>

              <p>
                You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
                of your account information, such as your username and password,
                and for restricting access to your computer and other devices;
                you agree and understand that you will be liable for any
                activity occurring through your account.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-3xl font-bold">
                6. Your license to the service
              </h4>

              <p>
                You may be and hereby are granted a license to use the Service
                and Output Data for (and solely for) your personal and/or your
                internal business purposes only, subject to the prohibitions and
                restrictions herein, and a license to store, print or make a
                copy of Output Data we provide to you solely for your personal
                or internal business purposes. You may not resell, distribute,
                or create derivative works from the Service or the Output Data.
                You may not develop any service, product, toolset, dataset or
                derivative work from the Output Data or the Service, whether in
                aggregated or non-aggregated form, and whether in identified or
                de-identified form.
              </p>

                7. Data sharing and rights: our free services
              </h4>

              <p>
                When you provide Submitted Data through the Service, you
                understand and agree to the following, except where we and you
                have put in place a Premium Services Agreement (or other
                agreement) that expressly supersedes the below terms:
              </p>

              <p>
                a. The Licenses You Grant To Us. When you provide us with or
                make available to us any Submitted Data, such as names,
                addresses, business titles or phone numbers of contacts or other
                persons, you are granting us several licenses to use that data
                (and you are representing to us that you have the right to make
                this grant):
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You grant us a perpetual and irrevocable license to access and
                  use the Submitted Data in aggregated form, to provide, develop
                  and improve the Service and our data assets, so long as we do
                  not (i) in any public way refer to you or the company you work
                  for in relation to the Submitted Data (for instance, we will
                  never sell a list titled “List of Brand X’s Clients), or (ii)
                  use the Submitted Data in a way that violates any contract we
                  have entered into, or any law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You also provide us the perpetual and irrevocable right to
                  sublicense, make available, copy, display, publish or
                  distribute the Submitted Data to any third party, including
                  our customers, business partners, and service providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You provide us the right to create derivative works, data
                  models, or modeled data sets with the Submitted Data. You
                  agree that we will own those derivative works (but not the
                  actual Submitted Data that is distinct from those works).
                  Examples of derivative works (without limitation) would be,
                  for instance, if we create aggregated or modeled data sets
                  that combine data from numerous providers in order to form a
                  new or new type of data set. Another example would be if we
                  used multiple sets of Submitted Data (from multiple providers)
                  in order to derive data analytics about certain industries,
                  buyers, or industry prospects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You also agree that we have the perpetual and irrevocable
                  right to use, share, sublicense, display, copy, publish and
                  distribute the Submitted Data in aggregated, de-identified
                  form for any purpose, in any medium.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The foregoing license grants to Data-X shall be non-exclusive,
                  perpetual and royalty-free. Data-X shall have the right to
                  sublicense, assign, or transfer such licenses in its
                  discretion.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                b. The Representations You Make To Us. It is important to us
                that you have the right to grant us the licenses we’ve described
                above. If you don’t, please do not provide any Submitted Data to
                us. If you’re not sure whether you do, please take the time to
                confirm whether that is the case. We will still be here when
                you’re ready.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You therefore warrant and represent that you have all
                  necessary rights, permissions, and authority to provide the
                  Submitted Data to us (in whole and in part), and that doing so
                  will not put you in violation of any contracts you have signed
                  or any laws. We provide certain examples of laws that
                  theoretically could apply, so please continue to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You likewise warrant and represent that the Submitted Data
                  does not contain any information about individuals under the
                  age of 18.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You warrant and represent that providing the Submitted Data to
                  us does not violate the U.S. HIPAA law: for instance, it is
                  not a list of hospital or doctor’s patients, or a similar
                  dataset consisting of patients or clients of an entity covered
                  by HIPAA (this might include, for instance, a doctor, dentist,
                  chiropractor, acupuncturist, pharmacist or other health
                  professional). Similarly, you agree not to provide us with
                  Submitted Data consisting of a list of clients of an entity
                  covered by the GLBA, which applies to many types of financial
                  institutions including banks, hedge funds, investment advisers
                  and insurance companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You warrant and represent that you will only provide Submitted
                  Data to us that is true and accurate, and of living persons.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                c. Nature of Exchange. Our Service contains certain
                “co-operative” elements. This means that in exchange for
                providing the Submitted Data to us, and potentially for the use
                of other customers (at our sole discretion), you will receive
                access to Output Data consisting of information that we hope is
                equally valuable to you. While we strive to make this a fair and
                optimal exchange, you understand and agree that we may change
                these terms or the nature of the Service at any time, or alter
                the amount of Output Data or other access we provide – and you
                agree that it is in our sole discretion to do so. We likewise
                may terminate your account or access to the Service at any time,
                for any reason, including (without limitation) any violation of
                these Terms of Service by you or through your account.
                Additional rules or policies may be displayed or put in place
                through the Service, including any portal through which you
                submit or receive data; those rules or policies are incorporated
                by reference into these Terms of Service and you agree to adhere
                to them.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-3xl font-bold">
                8. Paid and subscription accounts; Self-Serve credits
              </h4>

              <p>
                We also may provide the Service through paid accounts, such as
                by offering a monthly or annual subscription, or through
                customized provision of services and payment terms. If you and
                we agree to do so, we will enter into a separate agreement with
                you, governed by an applicable further Order Form (“Order
                Form”). If you wish to enter into such an agreement, please
                contact us at support@data-x.dev. In addition (unless otherwise
                agreed to by you and us), the following will apply to any paid
                Service we provide to you:
              </p>

              <p>
                Sometimes we offer the Service on a “self-serve” basis, in which
                case you will have the opportunity to click through these Terms
                and select the aspects of the Service you want to purchase,
                including an amount of credits that can be used for data. When
                you purchase credits, they have an expiration date, which is
                generally the end of your billing cycle – for most accounts, the
                end of the month.{" "}
                <strong>
                  Do not purchase credits if you are not able to use them during
                  your billing cycle.
                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                a. You agree to pay to us the applicable fees (the “Fees”) set
                forth in an Order Form (whether agreed to on paper or digitally)
                signed or otherwise agreed to by you and by us, based on the
                timetable set forth in the Order Form. We may increase or
                otherwise change the Fees at the end of any given calendar year
                or at the end of any Term set forth in an Order Form, in our
                sole discretion, by providing you with written notice (which may
                be by email or another conspicuous method).
              </p>

              <p>
                b. You must raise any disputes regarding Fees within 60 days
                from receipt of the (first) applicable invoice. Any disputes not
                waived within that time period shall be deemed waived.
              </p>

              <p>
                c. Invoices must be paid in full no later than thirty (30) days
                from the date on which they are received. Unpaid amounts are
                subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding
                balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower,
                plus all expenses of collection (including reasonable attorneys
                fees) that we may incur. We reserve the right to terminate
                service immediately where bills are more than sixty (60) days in
                arrears.
              </p>

              <p>
                d. You are responsible for all taxes associated with the Service
                other than taxes based on our net income.
              </p>

              <p>
                e. The agreement is for the Initial Service Term as specified in
                the Order Form, and shall be automatically renewed for
                additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Service
                Term, unless either party requests non-renewal at least thirty
                (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. The
                subscription is on a per-seat basis, and is for a single “seat”
                or user unless otherwise indicated in the Order Form. We may
                permit you (in our discretion) to increase the number of seats
                or users licensed to you during a term, in which case we will
                then begin to charge you at the new per-seat price. While you
                may (in our discretion) increase the number of seats during a
                term, you may not decrease the number of seats during a term:
                once you increase your per-seat license, you will be charged on
                that per-seat basis through the remainder of a term. You may not
                seat-share or time-share: you may only permit one license seat
                per individual user, at any given time.
              </p>

              <p>
                f. In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party
                may also terminate this agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice

                Policy in order to prevent potential abuse. The credit limit is
                10,000 credits per account per month for non-paying accounts on
                an Unlimited Plan, or the lesser of $ Paid / $0.025 or 1 Million
                credits per account per year for paying accounts on an Unlimited
                Plan, unless we will enter into a separate agreement with you

                day before your next recurring billing date in order to avoid
                being charged. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no
                refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any
                cancellation, however, you may choose to have access to the

                time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or
                other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”).
                The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide
                them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of
                credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the
                future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide
                credits in the future, under any circumstance.

                job title, or contact information), which we refer to below as
                European Output Data.” If you do so, you agree that you will use

                <strong> in addition </strong>to complying with other consent or

                hygiene or updating of your own legally obtained customer
                database. For instance (simply to illustrate), if you possess a

                Output Data, sufficient to comply with the consent requirements
                of GDPR.

                business-to-business relationships and in compliance with the
                GDPR and all other legal requirements. For instance, if you use

                processor, as those terms are used under the GDPR. You will
                obtain from each data subject (e.g., the persons in your
                customer database) all required consents (or establish another
                basis for processing the Output Data, if applicable), make

                us regarding any European Data Subjects unless you have obtained
                legally sufficient consent to do so from the data subject of

                order to market to any person or process any person’s personal
                data, Client agrees that Client shall obtain on Client’s own

                  without resort to litigation. You and we agree to use
                  reasonable efforts to settle any dispute or claim, and good

                  property infringement. To commence this procedure, you agree

                  informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial

                  resolve by arbitration any and all controversies, claims, or

                  any other aspect of the Service.These Terms of Service are

                  lawfully can be arbitrated, except for those claims and
                  disputes which by the terms of these Terms of Service are

                  Governing Arbitration Rules. All claims subject to arbitration
                  shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered
                  by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS rules in effect at the
                  time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or
                  procedures that would permit class actions or other
                  representative actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal,
                  state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
                  authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating
                  to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
                  formation of these Terms of Service including but not limited
                  to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service
                  (such as this Section 18) is void or voidable, or whether a
                  claim is subject to arbitration, except that the arbitrator
                  shall have no authority to find that a claim may proceed on a
                  class basis or as part of another representative action: only
                  a court may address disputes regarding the validity or
                  enforceability of the Class Action Waiver section below,
                  Section 18(A)(v). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant
                  whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in
                  equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be
                  binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any
                  court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration,
                  unless there are conflicting rules at www.jamsadr.com, you
                  must do the following: (A) Write a Demand for Arbitration that
                  includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages
                  you seek to recover. You may find a copy of a Demand for
                  Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com; (B) Send three copies of the
                  Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to
                  JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco
                  California 94111; and (C) Send one copy of the Demand for
                  Arbitration to us at 101 Montgomery Street, Suite 400, San
                  Francisco, CA 94104.

              </ol>

              <p>
                To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the
                cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. If
                the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we
                will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the
                arbitration, provided your claim does not seek more than
                $75,000. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any
                remedies available under applicable law, and the arbitrator
                shall award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party,
                except as prohibited by law. The parties understand that, absent
                this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in
                court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in
                some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs
                of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in
                arbitration than in court.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take
                place at any reasonable location within the United States
                convenient for you. For residents outside the United States,
                arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County,
                California, United States of America, and you and we agree to
                submit to the personal jurisdiction of any court in San
                Francisco County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to
                stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
                vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                arbitrator.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Class Action Waiver. The parties agree that the arbitration
                  shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not
                  as a class action or other representative action, and the
                  parties expressly waive their right to file a class action,
                  seek relief on a class basis, or join or serve as a member of
                  a class action. YOU AND DATA-X AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
                  CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL
                  CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                  PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If for any
                  reason the proper decisionmaker determines that the waiver of
                  class and representative actions set forth in this paragraph
                  is void or unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on
                  a class or representative basis, then Section 18(A) and
                  Section 18(B) shall be deemed null and void in their entirety
                  and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to
                  arbitrate disputes.

                <li>
                  30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not
                  be bound by this version of Section 18 by sending written
                  notice of your decision to opt out to support@data-x.dev with
                  the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
                  OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of
                  the first date on or after May 25, 2018 that you agree to any
                  version of these Terms of Service that contains this version
                  of Section 18. If you do not opt out, you will be bound to
                  arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this
                  Section 18. You have the right to consult with counsel of your
                  choice concerning this Section 18. You understand that you
                  will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right
                  to opt out of coverage under this Section 18. If you opt out
                  of Section 18, we also will not be bound by it in its disputes
                  with you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changes to this Section. Data-X will provide (60) days’ notice
                  of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective
                  on the sixtieth (60th) day, and will apply prospectively only
                  to claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day. If a court or
                  arbitrator (in either case, with the authority to make such
                  decision) decides that this subsection on “Changes to This
                  Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection
                  shall be severed from Section 18 and the court or arbitrator
                  shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
                  section you agreed to.

                Section 18 (Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) shall be

                  Intellectual Property Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’
                  decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either
                  Party may bring an action on an individual (not class or
                  representative action) basis in state or federal court or in
                  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its patents,
                  copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but

                  Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to
                  resolve all disputes through arbitration, either Party may
                  seek relief in a small claims court on an individual (not
                  class or representative action) basis for disputes or claims
                  within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

              <p>
                The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Data-X
                shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
                California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                Any claim or dispute either of us may have against the other
                that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court
                located in San Francisco County, California (or by a small
                claims court located elsewhere in the United States when Section
                18(b)(ii) applies). We both agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County,
                California (or a small claims court located elsewhere in the
                United States when Section 18(b)(ii) applies), for the purpose
